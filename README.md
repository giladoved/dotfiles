# My Dotfiles

These dotfiles are designed for Mac

### Steps to adapt

1. Fork / clone the repo

2. Run the install shell script: `./install`
If you get an error, you might need to make the install script executable: `chmod u+x install.sh`

3. Press prefix (Ctrl-A) + I to fetch tmux plugins

4. Open vim and enter: `:PlugInstall`
If you get errors installing the vim plugins, make sure you have installed the xcode dev tools: `xcode-select --install`

5. Restart your terminal

### iTerm Settings

- For the same terminal color theme as vim: set the theme to `base16-oceanicnext.dark.256.itermcolors`

- Automatically join your tmux session by sending the following text at start: `tmux attach -t mysession || tmux new -s mysession`
